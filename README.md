# React + ThreeJs

### Motivation
I'm trying to learn and practice using Three.js with react scuh as moving 3D models with drag-and-drop and controlling 3D models with the mouse.

### Conclusion
I discovered React Three Fiber after working on this, and it makes controlling 3D models with React much easier to learn. ðŸ˜†
